= DynamoDB Hello World with Java

. Create DynamoDB table `Books` as explained at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SampleData.CreateTables.html.
. Run the application:
+
```
mvn install
```
+
This will store a JSON document to the database, and read it back.
+
By default, the application thinks that the database is in `us-west-1` region. Alternatively, a different region can be specified:
+
```
mvn install -DDYNAMODB_REGION=<region>
```
